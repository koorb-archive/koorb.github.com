Us web designers have been presented with two problems over the years; firstly the expense and complex licensing of quality fonts. Secondly the lack of choice to use anything more than Helvitica (or worse Arial) and Times New Roman for text on a web page.

When I started design some 10 years ago there was already a number websites around where you could download free fonts, [dafont.com](http://dafont.com) among one of my most frequently visited. The problem with this though was how low the quality was. Sure, there would be the odd gem or two but largely they were outrageous display fonts or just poorly just constructed and only available in a single weight.

## The emergence

Well if your in the business (of web design) then you will no doubt – or at least you really should – be aware of how the tide has turned and we are seeing far better resources for quality freeware fonts licensed for commercial use such as [Font Squirrel](http://www.fontsquirrel.com).

We have now emerged from sadly lacking days of such techniques as [Dynamic Text Replacement](http://www.alistapart.com/articles/dynatext/), [Cufón](http://cufon.shoqolate.com/generate/) or (it makes me shudder just to type this) [sIFR](http://www.mikeindustries.com/blog/sifr). Indeed we are now being overwhelmed with an abundance not just of a standard technique (@font-face) but also of good – or even high – quality fonts.

Font Squirrel list quality font's that have full families of weights and variants. They also offer hundreds of [@font-face kits](http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fontface) ready to go.


All of the fonts are Open Source

If you didn't know that Google provide an alternative to typekit [Google Webfonts](http://www.google.com/webfonts/) (inventive yes?) then perhaps you've been making friends with the Nasa's rover Curiosity.
