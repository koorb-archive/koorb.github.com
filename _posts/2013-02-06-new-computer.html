<p>You can say what you like, this is an amazing machine. Take a look at the video, can you guess what it is?</p>

<p>The cursor is ready in ten seconds, the thing is booted and ready in little more. It's what this computer represents that I love. This thing is from a time when having a PC at home was a technological wonder, having somthing you could move around.</p>
