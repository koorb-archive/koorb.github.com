Us web designers have been presented with two problems over the years; firstly the expense and complex licensing of quality fonts. Secondly the lack of choice to use anything more than Helvitica (or worse Arial) and Times New Roman for text on a web page.

When I started design some 10 years ago there was already a number websites around where you could download free fonts, [dafont.com](http://dafont.com) among one of my most frequently visited. The problem with this though was how low the quality was. Sure, there would be the odd gem or two but largely they were outrageous display fonts or just poorly just constructed.
